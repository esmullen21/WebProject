# WebProject
The website I completed as part of me Web and User Interface Design module. 

We were asked to submit a design of our website, using the design principles we learned e.g. Gestalt laws, Learning theories etc, and to submit wireframes and paper prototypes of the website. We had to provide these for 3 different sizes, desktop, tablet and mobile phone. 

Then we had to write the code for the website we designed, host it and test it. There were some specific HTMl, CSS and JavaScript requirements that had to be met. For example we were given a list of HTML technologies and we had to include two. We also had to use two bits of JavaScript, one of which we must have written ourselves (please see my .js file in the css+js folder for the converter I wrote). 

To test the site, we had to host it. Mine is still hosted on my Google Drive and can be found at the following link:
